# LLM Group Study Report

## Introduction

This study group aims to enhance understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) and learn related technologies.<br>
Starting with the comparison, introduction, and overview of LLM models, the ultimate goal is to conduct a project.

## Target Audience

* Individuals interested in LLMs
* Individuals with a basic understanding of Python programming
* Individuals with a basic understanding of machine learning and deep learning

## Methodology

* Online (Discord room: [Discord 방 링크](Discord 링크))
* Weekly regular meetings (Every Wed. 21:00 ~ 22:00 (UTC +09:00))
* Focus on presentations, discussions, and practical exercises

## Schedule

| Week | Learning Content | Objectives | Resources |
|---|---|---|---|
| Week1 | LLM Overview | Understand the basic concepts of LLMs | [Resource 1](study_materials/week1_overview.pdf) |
| Week2 | LLM Model Comparison (GPT, Claude, etc.) | Compare the characteristics of various LLM models | [Resource 2](study_materials/week2_comparison.pdf) |

## Resource List
